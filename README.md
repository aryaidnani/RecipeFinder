# RECIPE FINDER

#Current Features (as of March 6)

1) Recipe Postings get rendered by iterating through an array which contains their information in individual objects
2) Each recipe consists of a like button, and can detect when it has been clicked (currently displayed to console)
3) Like button functionality is limited to updating and storing liked recipes in local storage

#Things which need to be worked on

1) Currently Recipes grid resizes itself because of grid display, but individual recipes need to be improved
2) Hero Image needs to be replaced with slideshow
3) Page responsiveness needs to be implemented

4) Remaining part of the like function needs to be completed, ie: the rendering part. Mostly through re-rendering existing recipes' grid
5) Interactive Modals need to be implemented for each recipe
6) Filtering needs to be implemented.
